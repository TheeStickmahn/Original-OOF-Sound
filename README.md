This is a simple program that changes the roblox OOF sound back to the original meme oof!

Step 1: Double click Run Me.exe

It should now work!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can change what the oof sound becomes by changing the "Ouch.ogg" file with your own
ogg file.

Step 1: Download the audio.
Step 2: Go to any mp3 to ogg converter.
Step 3: Convert it and download it
Step 4: Rename it to "Ouch.ogg" and drag it into the "files" folder.

//OUCH.OGG WILL BE DELETED AFTER RUNNING THE PROGRAM//
